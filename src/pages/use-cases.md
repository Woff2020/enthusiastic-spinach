  - title: Agriculture
    content: A growing part of modern agriculture and Agritech specifically, is the
      ability to digest a multitude of inputs from soil samples, satellite data, weather
      and historic and give actionable predictions on irrigation and pest control
      as well as on future yields. In an ecosystem where nothing is stable, adaptive
      real-time Machine Learning holds a major advantage.

  - title: Industrial Automation
    content: As industrial manufacturing is moving into the 4th industrial revolution
      with digitization and automation, the ability to predict outcomes becomes more
      crucial. Machine Learning in predictive maintenance can help to identify malfunctions
      before they occur. Large amounts of sensor data digested in real-time by a Machine
      Learning algorithm can perform manufacturing operation optimization and streamline
      supply chain management.

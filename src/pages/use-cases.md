  - title: Agriculture
    content: A growing part of modern agriculture and Agritech specifically, is the
      ability to digest a multitude of inputs from soil samples, satellite data, weather
      and historic and give actionable predictions on irrigation and pest control
      as well as on future yields. In an ecosystem where nothing is stable, adaptive
      real-time Machine Learning holds a major advantage.

  - title: Healthcare and Pharma
    content: Healthcare institutes and Pharma companies collect and analyze huge quantities
      of data points and need a quick response with measurable accuracy. Real-time
      algorithms can help them deliver better outcomes while adjusting to new inputs.
      Unknown circumstances such as new virus strain can benefit from a quick turnaround
      of a real-time machine learning algorithm with an ability to adjust to new inputs.

  - title: Industrial Automation
    content: As industrial manufacturing is moving into the 4th industrial revolution
      with digitization and automation, the ability to predict outcomes becomes more
      crucial. Machine Learning in predictive maintenance can help to identify malfunctions
      before they occur. Large amounts of sensor data digested in real-time by a Machine
      Learning algorithm can perform manufacturing operation optimization and streamline
      supply chain management.

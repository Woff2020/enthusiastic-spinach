        Real-time machine learning has access to a continuous flow of transactional data, but what it really needs in order to be effective is a continuous flow of labeled transactional data, and accurate labeling introduces latency

    content: AutoML approach is different, in this approach we don’t need a human.
      Because program makes feature engineering, model trains by automate. AutoML
      is open domain — we can run the same algorithm on any type of data like credit
      scoring, sales stock, text classifications, and others.
  - content: We have surveyed AutoML deep learning approaches, but this is just one
      class of AutoML techniques you can find in predictive modeling. In general,
      AutoML approaches are most efficient in following domains, optimizing performance,
      speed for predictive models or both. There are also many other criteria that
      can be taken into account such as explainability of predictive models, however
      AutoML capable of optimizing those criteria are in their infancy.
